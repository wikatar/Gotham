## Data Import System

### Design Principles

- **üéØ Design target**: Palantir Foundry-level traceability + input lineage
- **üß¨ Data Lineage**: Every data row is linked to its source with complete mapping documentation
- **üõ† Transformation**: Data cleaning pipelines are built on top of raw data with full traceability
- **üìä Versioning**: All imported data is versioned for historical analysis and audit
- **üîç Accountability**: Full tracking of who imported what data and when

### Features

- **High-fidelity ingestion** with field traceability
- **Clean separation** between data ingestion and semantic modeling
- **Extensible architecture** for versioning, type inference, and data quality checks
- **Full audit logging** of all data import activities
- **Support for CSV** data with automatic field mapping

## Tech Stack
